<h2>Customer Speech:</h2>
“Let me start by explaining a few key terms we use in our operations.
A worksite is any location where our projects are executed.
This can range from a large construction site to smaller sub-sites within a bigger project.
We categorize these worksites to manage them more effectively. Most of the time we handle our worksites by our self,
but sometimes we have lack of resources or budget, so we maybe assign the whole worksite to an external party(contractor),
or just one or two sub-worksites, and we manage the rest,

A **contractor** is an external party we hire to perform specific tasks or manage certain aspects of a worksite.
They are not our employees but work under contract for specific projects.

A **customer** is the entity that commissions our services.
They are the ones for whom we execute our projects and to whom we deliver our final product.

We also have **suppliers**, who are companies, persons, or brokers that provide us with the necessary materials and items for our worksites.
These suppliers are a third party that we always buy products from.
Managing these suppliers effectively is crucial for ensuring we have the resources we need when we need them.


Now, let me tell you what we need to manage all these elements effectively.”

<h3>Contractor,Customer, Suppliers Management:</h3>
“We need a robust system to manage our contractors.
This includes storing their details, tracking their **contracts**, and monitoring their assignments.
Similarly, managing our **customers** is equally important.
We need to maintain detailed records of our customers and keep track
of all interactions and projects we undertake for them.
We also need to manage our **suppliers**, including their contracts and the materials they provide.”


<h3>Employee and Resource Management</h3>

“Managing our employees is another key aspect.
We need a system to store their details, roles, and track their work assignments.
Employees often work at multiple worksites, so we need a daily record of where each employee is working.
It’s important for us to know where everyone is at any given time to manage the workforce efficiently.
Additionally, managing resources on the worksite, including equipment and materials, is crucial.
We need to allocate and track resources effectively.”

<h3>Warehouse and Inventory Management</h3>

“When it comes to inventory, our storekeepers need to manage inventory levels at both the main and sub-worksite levels.
They should be able to transfer materials between the main site and sub-sites to balance inventory levels and ensure materials are available where needed.
This includes receiving materials into the warehouse, issuing them for use, and transferring between different warehouses if necessary.
They should also monitor current inventory levels to keep stock balanced and reorder when necessary.”


<h3>Worksite Management</h3>

“For worksites, we often have a main worksite that oversees several smaller sub-worksites.
We need the ability to create these main worksites and add new sub-worksites under them as our projects grow.
It’s crucial for our worksite managers to see all the sub-worksites under their main worksite to oversee operations effectively.
Sometimes, we assign specific worksites or sub-worksites to external contractors, and we need a way to monitor their progress.”

<h3>Order Management</h3>

“Our worksite managers need to place orders for materials to keep the inventory stocked.
Before these orders are processed, they should be reviewed and approved by administrators to ensure only necessary purchases are made.
It’s important for managers to track the status of their orders and cancel them if they are no longer needed to avoid unnecessary expenses.”

<h3>Reporting and Analytics</h3>

“Finally, we need comprehensive reporting and analytics.
Administrators should be able to generate reports on resource utilization to optimize inventory management.
Managers need to view analytics on expenses to identify cost-saving opportunities and track budget adherence across different worksites to ensure financial stability.
Storekeepers should be able to generate inventory reports to reconcile stock levels and identify discrepancies.
And since each worksite may have multiple site managers and storekeepers,
the system should support this structure.”

<h3>Expense Tracking</h3>

“Tracking expenses is crucial for us.
We need to record expenses related to employee salaries,
log expenses for materials purchased,
and review these expenses across different categories to monitor overall spending.
Managers should be able to categorize expenses for budgeting purposes to ensure funds are allocated appropriately.”

<h3>Budget Control</h3>

“Budget control is essential.
We need to set budget limits for each worksite to control expenses and prevent overspending.
Managers should receive notifications when expenses approach or exceed these limits, so they can take corrective action.
Administrators should have the flexibility to adjust budget allocations as needed to manage resources efficiently,
and managers should be able to view the current budget status to make informed financial decisions.”
